Here is a page for information and links to the Mininet Projects for Google Summer of Code 2013. In addition to these pages, I encourage discussion on `mininet-discuss` and also via GitHub pull requests. We may also create an IRC channel for all of the GSoC projects at onlab if people think that would be useful.

Participants: Please feel free to create the pages for your projects and also to edit this page as desired.

We are pleased to have five GSoC students this summer, working on the following projects:

* [[Automatic Mininet Network Creation based on a real network]] - easily and automatically creating a Mininet network based on a physical network topology

* [[Web Interface for Sharing Mininet systems]] - making it easy to upload and share Mininet systems

* [[Mininet Network-in-a-Box and Automatic Deployment on EC2]] - easy creation of Mininet network-in-a-box systems (e.g on small, cheap computers), and easy/automatic creation/deployment of Mininet networks on EC2 or other public clouds

* [[Mininet System Testing]] - improving Mininet's system level tests and testing infrastructure

* [[Link Modeling using ns-3]] - allowing ns-3 to be used for realistic emulation of wired and wireless links in a Mininet network
