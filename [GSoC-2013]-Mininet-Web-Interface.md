## Mininet Module Repository
The purpose of this project is to enable users to share their modules and have other users to be able to easily install it.

### Packaging Format
Before any modules can be shared, a packaging format has to be defined for Mininet modules first. We have decided that the Mininet packaging format is just a plain old Python packaging format based on `setuptools` and `distutils`.

### Components
- A website, [Mininet Repo](https://github.com/heryandi/djangopypi2), documentation available [here](https://github.com/heryandi/gsoc2013-onl-mininet/wiki/Mininet-Repo-Docs).
