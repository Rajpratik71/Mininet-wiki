### Teaching and Learning using Mininet

The following programming assignments are based on the ones we use in Stanford CS144 'An Introduction to Computer Networks'. Mininet is used to emulate the network topology in these assignments.

### Course Projects

* [[Simple Router]] - Implementing a simple IP router
* [[Network Address Translator (NAT)]] - Implementing a simple Network Address Translator
* [[Pee-Wee OSPF (PWOSPF)]] - Implementing a simple link state routing protocol

### Lab Exercises

* [[BufferBloat]] - A simple (potentially in-class) lab exercise to observe the buffer bloat problem using Mininet

### Security Demo
* [[MAC Address Table Overflow Attack]] - A demonstration on MAC address table overflow attack
* [[DHCP Masquerade Attack]] - A demonstration of DHCP masquerade attack

### Reproducible Network Research Experiments

For Stanford CS244, students recreated published networking research experiments in the Mininet environment to see whether the experiment produced the expected result. If so, was the experiment set up correctly and realistically so that it accurately validates the result? If not, is it due to the experimental setup, emulator limitations, or errors in the original wor?
