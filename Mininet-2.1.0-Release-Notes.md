Potential Gotchas

Errata

* Currently `--switch user` cannot be used with `--mac`; there appears to be a bug where it does not correctly match and forward packets when the MAC address is 00:00:00:00:00:01

* Currently `--switch ivs` cannot be used with more than a few switches; a bug has been submitted to the IVS developers
