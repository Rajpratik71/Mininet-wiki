Does anybody try to use mininet by ubuntu desktop GUI?

Today, I am trying to install ubuntu desktop GUI in my newest version mininet.
I use
`sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop`
It install sucessfully.
But when I try to log in mininet with ubuntu-desktop GUI, there is a problem.
I am trying to log in with user name:mininet, and PSD:mininet(They are both correct). The result is that I can not log in.It does not say I enter the wrong PSD. It just start the welcome-page again. when I enter my PSD again, it says nothing again and back the log-in page.

What is going on? Anybody got an idea? 

Thanks for your help.
