The following programming assignments are based on the ones we use in Stanford CS144 'An Introduction to Computer Networks'. Mininet is used to emulate the network topology in these assignments.

### Course Projects

* [[Simple Router]] - Implementing a simple IP router
* [[Network Address Translator (NAT)]] - Implementing a simple Network Address Translator
* [[Pee-Wee OSPF (PWOSPF)]] - Implementing a simple link state routing protocol

### Lab Exercises

* [[BufferBloat]] - A simple (potentially in-class) lab exercise to observe the buffer bloat problem using Mininet

### Security Demo
* [[MAC Address Table Overflow Attack]] - A demonstration on MAC address table overflow attack
* [[DHCP Masquerade Attack]] - A demonstration of DHCP masquerade attack
