  This paper advocates changing the practice of computer networking research (and CS in general),
by demonstrating *reproducible* experiments using Mininet-HiFi, aka Mininet 2.0, and includes an overview of
its design as well as experiences using Mininet to reproduce 16 published network experiments.
